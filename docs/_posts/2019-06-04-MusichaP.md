## Protocol


* Step 1

Genomic DNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using 100 bp PE

* Step 2
Velvet v1.2.09 was used for de novo genome assembly 

* Step 3 

Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected through the ResFinder database using thresholds of 95.0% and 90.0% for nucleotide identity and sequence coverage, respectively.
