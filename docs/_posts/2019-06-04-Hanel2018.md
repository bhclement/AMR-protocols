## Database
This protocol uses ResFinderfor detection of AMR genes in A. skirrowii. Database version not mentioned.


## Protocol

* Step 1
DNA was purified using High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit and sequencing libraries were generated using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit. 


* Step 2
Paired-end reads were generated using Illumina MiSeq

* Step 3
Further read processing included quality trimming and assembly with SPAdes 3.9.1 and filtering by removing contigs with a coverage < 5 and a length < 500. Quality was assessed with QUAST 4.3


* Step 4
Annotation was performed with Prokka using the recommended standard settings.

* Step 5 
Resistance genes were predicted using the ResFinder
