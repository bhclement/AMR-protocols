## Database

ARG-Annot database in Kleborate


## Protocol


* Step 1

Genomic DNA was sequenced using the MiniSeq or MiSeq (Illumina) and MinION (Oxford Nanopore) 

* Step 2

SPAdes v3.8.1 was used for de novo assembly of short reads data  
Unicycler v0.4.4 was used for hybrid assembly of short and long reads data

* Step 3 

Antimicrobial resistance genes were searched through the database using thresholds of ≥ 90.0% for both nucleotide identity and sequence coverage.
